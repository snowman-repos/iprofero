Version 0.1.3 - 2013-10-02

- Added support for one-time string interpolation to all options

Version 0.1.2 - 2013-09-08

- Fixed the CSS classes so the directive gets rendered consistently across different browsers

Version 0.1.1 - 2013-08-17

- Removed allowed-chars-pattern option since it wouldn't prevent invalid chars from being inserted by pasting data from the clipboard. The allowed-tags-pattern optiin is the correct way to validate input from now on
